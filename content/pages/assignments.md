## Midterm Exam 

The exam will consist of 6 short-answer questions covering the material of the first 9 weeks. Most of the questions will be drawn from a list posted during Week 8. Others may be drawn from the questions in the weekly reading guides.

The exam will count for 30% of the final course grade.

## Final Paper

The final paper must be between 4000 and 5000 words and should either address in greater depth one of the case studies explored in class or develop a different case defined by an activist, movement, or event involving science activism after 1945 anywhere around the world.

Sample topics include:

- An analysis of Soviet nuclear physicist Andrei Sakharov’s 1968 article “[Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom](https://www.sakharov-center.ru/asfconf2009/english/node/20)”
- The 2017 [March for Science](https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/22/health/global-march-for-science/index.html)
- Examples of science activism from MIT

For some topics, the [MIT Archives](https://archivesspace.mit.edu/) and the [MIT Museum](http://mitmuseum.mit.edu/) will provide useful material not found elsewhere.

The final paper should include an introduction, literature review, description of the case study, analysis, and conclusions. Each student will prepare a 15-minute presentation of the idea for this paper in weeks 7 through 9 before the paper is due during week 12 and will participate in the discussion of other students’ ideas.

The final paper will count for 30% of the final course grade.
